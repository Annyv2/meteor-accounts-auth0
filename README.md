meteor-accounts-auth0
=====================

Auth0 login service for use with Meteor Auth.

### Setup

1. Create an `OpenID Connect (OAuth2) Web` application from [Auth0 Dashboard](https://app.auth0.com/#/applications/create).
2. Set App Callbacks URLs to: `{YOUR_APP_BASE_URL}/_oauth/auth0`.
3. Go to your application and configure the login service from server-side code:

~~~js
ServiceConfiguration.configurations.remove({ service: 'auth0' });
ServiceConfiguration.configurations.insert({
  service:      'auth0',
  domain:       '{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}',
  clientId:     '{YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}',
  clientSecret: '{YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET}'
});
~~~

ServiceConfiguration.configurations is exported by the service-configuration package:

    meteor add service-configuration

### Usage

1. `mrt add accounts-auth0`
2. Use [accounts-ui](http://docs.meteor.com/#accountsui) to handle login experience, or directly call:

~~~js
Meteor.loginWithAuth0();

// or specifying additional parameters like connection or popupOptions:
Meteor.loginWithAuth0({ connection: 'google-oauth2', popupOptions: { width: 320, height: 350 } });
~~~
